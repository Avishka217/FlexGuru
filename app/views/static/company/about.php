    <p class="body-1 gray">
      We are a complete resource for current or prospective students,
      Professionals, and Tutors. We give flexibility to the students and
      professionals to request or choose and learn the exact content they
      wish to learn. Without wasting valuable time by following a complete
      course or reading an entire book, we offer ranking for the students
      and tutors to improve their rating to get the best education while
      enjoying benefits from Flexguru. Customized learning requests are
      one of the uniqueness of our platform. Every student will be able to
      request the tutor while mentioning his needs and preferences in
      order to succeed easily.

    <p class="h3">How it all started</p>
    <p class="body-1 gray">
      We found that there is an issue in the common E-education system
      after the pandemic strikes and students moving towards online
      learning.
    </p>
    <p class="body-1 gray">
      "Without a problem, there is no innovation" in that perspective the
      problem we figured out is, students and professionals get doubts in
      specific parts of the subject in the learning process but there are
      no perfect solutions to overcome it. According to our country, every
      student does not get enough resources while learning and clearing
      doubts. so we group of undergraduate students came up with this idea
      to help students and professionals to give an easily accessible and
      flexible education as our vision suggests with a personalized
      learning dashboard.
