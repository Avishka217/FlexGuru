  <br>
  <h3 class=primary>How it all started</h3>
  <br>
  <p>We found that there is an issue in the common E-education system after the pandemic strikes and students moving towards online learning. <br>
    "Without a problem, there is no innovation" in that perspective the problem we figured out is, students and professionals get doubts in specific parts of the subject
    in the learning process but there are no perfect solutions to overcome it. According to our country, every student does not get enough resources while learning and clearing doubts. <br>
    so we group of undergraduate students came up with this idea to help students and professionals to give an easily accessible and flexible education as our vision suggests with a personalized learning dashboard.<br></p>
